# MLflow and scikit-learn

First, we introduce two common machine learning packages in the demo notebook.

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a machine learning library with various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, and model evaluation.
- [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/1.20.2/index.html) manages the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

Afterwards, we do coding tasks combining both of them.

# Data Loading and Preparation

First, we introduce two common packages in the demo notebooks.

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) offers multidimensional arrays and linear algebra functions.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) provides high-performance data structures and analysis tools.

Afterwards, we do coding tasks with both of them.

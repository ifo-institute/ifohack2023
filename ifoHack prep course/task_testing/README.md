# Testing

In this task, we write tests using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/) framework.
It detects and runs tests, evaluates their results, and even simplifies complex testing setups.

`main.py` contains three functions, and `test_main_task.py` contain corresponding unit tests for the first function.
Please add tests for the remaining functions, and think of possible edge cases.

To run tests, simply call `pytest` from this subdirectory.
pytest will detect and run the tests automatically, as the test files and functions have the suffix "test\_".

We offer a possible solution in `test_main_solution.py`.

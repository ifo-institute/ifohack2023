    "Residential segregation measures how spatially separated two poplation groups are located within census tracts (Massey & Denton, 1988). Massey and Denton (1988) defined several dimensions of residential segregation, such as (1) evenness, or the overrepresentation of a group in one area, (2) exposure, in which a group is rarely in the neighbourhood of another group, (3) concentration, where a single group occupies a limited amount of space, (4) centralization, and (5) clustering.\n",

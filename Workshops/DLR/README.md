### The challenge

>It is estimated that in 2020 45% of Germans lived in owned residences, marking the second lowest share of homeowners of all OECD countries.  At the same time, old-age poverty is predicted to be on the rise in Germany due to increasing housing costs, and will affect particularly vulnerable populations like tenants, homeowners with mortgages, single-person households and people with migration background. Population with migration background or low incomes are also more likely to suffer the consequences of environmental hazards and pollution. At the other end of the spectrum, accumulation of wealth is one of the less well-perceived drivers of inequalities in the country, with one of the most important forms of wealth for most households being wealth in real estate. This spatial ifoHack challenge aims to investigate the relationship between land prices and spatial factors that characterize living environments, in large and diverse cities in Germany, like Berlin, Bremen, Dresden, Frankfurt am Main and Köln. By exploring information extracted from satellite images and other relevant spatial datasets, we aim to guide participants into exploring non-conventional data sources, to answer relevant economic questions related to housing markets and spatial inequalities. Are land prices positively associated with a greater availability of spatial determinants of well-being, such as green and open spaces, or walkable and bicycle paths? Is proximity to amenities, educational, leisure or work opportunities a factor that drives higher land prices? Is there a spatial segregation effect in terms of land prices and specific population subgroups? These are only some of the questions we aim to explore together at the ifoHack. By getting to know the right spatial data and methods, formulating new ideas that fit your specific research interests will be only one short step away.

For the first time, the ifo Institute is organizing its very own hackathon – the ifoHack 2023.

The ifo Institute combines **sharp economic reasoning** and expert knowledge in **empirical methods**; using current advances in computational methods and **open-source tools** to leverage both yields enormous potential to address policy-oriented economic and social questions. For example, participants will build a predictive business climate model based on microdata provided by the ifo Institute and present its operating value via a web interface.

Our partners **KfW Bank** (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau) and **Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt** (German Aerospace Center) will also bring exciting challenges such as using Natural Language Processing for extracting sentiment from financial newspaper articles, predicting user behavior, or using spatial data for predicting real estate prices and will offer exclusive insights into their research activities.

## Challenges

1. **ifo "KT" Main challenge**

>In the ifo Business Survey every month approximately 9,000 German firms are surveyed on their current situation (status quo), recent developments (ex-post), and their plans and expectations for the near future (ex-ante). 
>
> Build a model which **predicts the categorical answers of firms** on various questions in the next 12 months. This model can be based on past answers and/or firm-specific information in the micro data of the survey (e.g., firm-size, region, sector).

2. **KfW challenge**
>KfW is the promotional bank of the Federal Republic of Germany - the transformation of the economy and society to improve economic, ecological and social living conditions worldwide is KfW's primary objective. With a balance of more than €500 billion KfW is the largest national promotional lender in the world and a reliable partner for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs), corporates and financial institutions worldwide. KfW’s ongoing regular operations span a wide array of promotional activities. They comprise lending to SMEs, energy efficiency and environmental protection, housing, infrastructure, and education, as well as project and export finance, and development cooperation. Hence, our credit analysts face the challenging task of assessing the credit risk – i.e. the possibility of a borrower defaulting on his debt – of a diverse cast of counterparties. As such they need to stay on top of current and past news developments on a global level.
Can you help them get a grip on the news?
You are provided with meta information on a set of entity articles published after 01.03.2022.
Vreate visualizations and/or tables which highlight news events containing coverage peaks for certain companies/special topics or other anomalies/patterns/cluster in the news article data.
Build a model in order to predict the likelihood of an article being read. Be mindful of and employ strategies accordingly when dealing with an unbalanced data set.

3. **DLR challenge**
>This spatial ifoHack challenge aims to investigate the relationship between land prices and spatial factors that characterize living environments, in large and diverse cities in Germany, like Berlin, Bremen, Dresden, Frankfurt am Main and Köln. By exploring information extracted from satellite images and other relevant spatial datasets, we aim to guide participants into exploring non-conventional data sources, to answer relevant economic questions related to housing markets and spatial inequalities. Are land prices positively associated with a greater availability of spatial determinants of well-being, such as green and open spaces, or walkable and bicycle paths? Is proximity to amenities, educational, leisure or work opportunities a factor that drives higher land prices? Is there a spatial segregation effect in terms of land prices and specific population subgroups? These are only some of the questions we aim to explore together at the ifoHack. By getting to know the right spatial data and methods, formulating new ideas that fit your specific research interests will be only one short step away.

4. **ifoGPT**
>Use a text corpus of past ifo press releases (use the one provided by us or collect your own) to develop a large language (e.g. transformer) model such as GPT or BERT and provide an intuitive ML-frontend to automatically generate a press release based on keywords such as "positive", "manufacturing sector" and "macroeconomy".
